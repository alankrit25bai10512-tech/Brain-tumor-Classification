# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification Project Details
This document summarizes the Problem Statement, Scope, Target Users, and High-Level Features for the Brain Tumor Classification project. The project uses transfer learning to build an image classification model that analyzes brain MRI scans and outputs a diagnosis among a small set of classes.

 ## 🛑 1. Problem Statement

Manual interpretation of brain MRI scans is time-consuming and can be subjective. Radiologists and clinicians may face high workloads, variable inter-observer agreement, and delays that affect patient care. The project aims to create an automated, reliable, and fast screening tool that provides consistent preliminary classification of MRI images into clinically relevant categories (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, No Tumor) to assist clinicians, speed triage, and support research.

##  🎯 2. Scope of the Project

 **✅ 2.1. In Scope (Deliverables):**
  * **Data preparation and augmentation pipeline using `Image Data Generator` to improve generalization on limited datasets.** 
  * **Model development and comparison using Transfer Learning (specifically VGG16 and ResNet50 backbones) with a custom classification head.** 
  * **Training, validation, and comprehensive evaluation (accuracy and loss reporting) on labeled MR images organized in a directory structure.** 

 **🚫 2.2. Out of Scope (Exclusions):**
  * **Clinical deployment, integration with hospital PACS, or regulatory approval workflows.** 
  * **Pixel-level tasks such as segmentation or bounding-box detection (this project focuses solely on whole-image classification).**  
  * **Support for other imaging modalities (e.g., CT, X-ray) unless explicitly extended in future phases.** 

 ## 🧑‍⚕️ 3. Target Users
 * **Radiologists: receive a fast, automated second opinion to prioritize and triage cases.** 
 * **Neurologists / Oncologists: obtain quick preliminary classifications to inform further diagnostics and treatment planning.**
 * **Medical researchers: use the codebase and trained models as a reproducible baseline for experimentation and improvement.**  
 * **Medical students / educators: use the models and visualizations as teaching aids for MRI pattern recognition.** 
  

## ✨ 4. High-Level Features

* **Four-class classification: accepts an MRI image (224×224 RGB) and outputs probabilities for {Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, No Tumor}.**
* **Transfer learning backbone: VGG16 and ResNet50 pretrained on ImageNet with a frozen base and a small trainable classification head.**
* **Data augmentation: on-the-fly image augmentation (rotation, width/height shifts, zoom, horizontal flip) to reduce overfitting.**
* **Training & evaluation: training scripts/notebook that log accuracy and validation accuracy, plot training histories, and evaluate final models with `model.evaluate().**

## ⚠️ Important Note
* **This project is intended as a research/educational prototype and not as a clinical diagnostic tool. Any clinical use would require extensive validation, regulatory approval, and integration with clinical workflows.**
